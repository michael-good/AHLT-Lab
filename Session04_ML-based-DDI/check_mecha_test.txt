There is a significant increase in exposure to imatinib when Gleevec is coadministered with ketoconazole (CYP3A4 inhibitor).
Pretreatment of healthy volunteers with multiple doses of rifampin followed by a single dose of Gleevec, increased Gleevec oral-dose clearance by 3.8-fold, which significantly (p 0.05) decreased mean cmax and AUC(0-8).
Drugs that may have their plasma concentration altered by Gleevec Gleevec increases the mean cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, suggesting an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by Gleevec.
Gleevec will increase plasmaconcentration of other CYP3A4 metabolized drugs (e.g., triazolo-benzodiazepines, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, etc.).

Systemic exposure to acetaminophen is expected to be increased when coadministered with Gleevec.
In normal volunteers receiving indomethacin, the administration of diflunisal decreased the renal clearance and significantly increased the plasma levels of indomethacin.
In a study in normal volunteers, it was found that chronic concurrent administration of 3.6 g of aspirin per day decreases indomethacin blood levels approximately 20%.
When INDOCIN is given to patients receiving probenecid, the plasma levels of indomethacin are likely to be increased.
INDOCIN has been reported to decrease the tubular secretion of methotrexate and to potentiate its toxicity.
Capsules INDOCIN 50 mg t.i.d. produced a clinically relevant elevation of plasma lithium and reduction in renal lithium clearance in psychiatric patients and normal subjects with steady state plasma lithium concentrations.
INDOCIN given concomitantly with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin.
however, in a study of 12 normal subjects, concurrent administration of aspirin decreased ketoprofen protein binding and increased ketoprofen plasma clearance from 0.07 L/kg/h without aspirin to 0.11 L/kg/h with aspirin.
however, in a study of 12 normal subjects, concurrent administration of aspirin decreased ketoprofen protein binding and increased ketoprofen plasma clearance from 0.07 L/kg/h without aspirin to 0.11 L/kg/h with aspirin.
Probenecid: Probenecid increases both free and bound ketoprofen by reducing the plasma clearance of ketoprofen to about one-third, as well as decreasing its protein binding.
Methotrexate: Ketoprofen, like other NSAIDs, may cause changes in the elimination of methotrexate leading to elevated serum levels of the drug and increased toxicity.
Methotrexate: Ketoprofen, like other NSAIDs, may cause changes in the elimination of methotrexate leading to elevated serum levels of the drug and increased toxicity.
Lithium: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents have been reported to increase steadystate plasma lithium levels.
Human growth hormone - Concomitant use of L-glutamine and human growth hormone may enhance nutrient absorption in those with severe short bowel syndrome.
Urinary acidifying agents These agents (ammonium chloride, sodium acid phosphate, etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion.

d-amphetamine with desipramine or protriptyline and possibly other tricyclics cause striking and sustained increases in the concentration of d-amphetamine in the brain;

d-amphetamine with desipramine or protriptyline and possibly other tricyclics cause striking and sustained increases in the concentration of d-amphetamine in the brain;
MAO inhibitors MAOI antidepressants, as well as a metabolite of furazolidone, slow amphetamine metabolism.
MAO inhibitors MAOI antidepressants, as well as a metabolite of furazolidone, slow amphetamine metabolism.
Ethosuximide: Amphetamines may delay intestinal absorption of ethosuximide.
Methenamine therapy Urinary excretion of amphetamines is increased, and efficacy is reduced by acidifying agents used in methenamine therapy.
Phenobarbital: Amphetamines may delay intestinal absorption of phenobarbital;
Phenytoin: Amphetamines may delay intestinal absorption of phenytoin;
The absorption of lymecycline may be affected by the simultaneous administration of indigestion remedies, iron or zinc supplements.
The absorption of lymecycline may be affected by the simultaneous administration of indigestion remedies, iron or zinc supplements.
Probenecid given concurrently increases naproxen anion plasma levels and extends its plasma half-life significantly.
Naproxen, naproxen sodium and other NSAIDs have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of methotrexate in an animal model, possibly increasing the toxicity of methotrexate.

Indinavir: Coadministration of indinavir with VIRACEPT resulted in an 83% increase in nelfinavir plasma AUC and a 51% increase in indinavir plasma A.C.
Ritonavir: Coadministration of ritonavir with VIRACEPT resulted in a 152% increase in nelfinavir plasma AUC and very little change in ritonavir plasma A.C.
Saquinavir: Coadministration of saquinavir (using an experimental soft-gelatin capsule formulation of saquinavir 1200mg) with VIRACEPT resulted in an 18% increase in nelfinavir plasma AUC and a 4-fold increase in saquinavir plasma A.C.
Ketoconazole: Coadministration of ketoconazole with VIRACEPT resulted in a 35% increase in nelfinavir plasma A.C.

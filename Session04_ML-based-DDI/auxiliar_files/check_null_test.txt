The fluoroquinolones are a rapidly growing class of antibiotics with a broad spectrum of activity against gram-negative and some gram-positive aerobic bacteria.

Combinations of clozapine and phencyclidine: effects on drug discrimination and behavioral inhibition in rats.

Phencyclidine (PCP) produces psychotomimetic effects in humans that resemble schizophrenia symptoms. 
In the present study, the atypical antipsychotic clozapine was tested in combination with an active dose of PCP in two-lever drug discrimination and mixed signalled-unsignalled differential-reinforcement-of-low-rates (DRL) procedures.

In the present study, the atypical antipsychotic clozapine was tested in combination with an active dose of PCP in two-lever drug discrimination and mixed signalled-unsignalled differential-reinforcement-of-low-rates (DRL) procedures. 
PCP produced distinctive effects in each task: it substituted for the training dose in PCP discrimination and it increased the number of responses with short (<3 s) interresponse times as well as increasing overall response rates in the DRL schedule. 
Acute dosing with clozapine failed to alter the behavioral effects of PCP in either procedure even when tested up to doses that produced pharmacological effects alone. 
These results suggest that acute dosing with clozapine would not affect behaviors most closely associated with PCP intoxication. 
Since chronic dosing is required for therapeutic efficacy of antipsychotics, future studies should focus on investigation of chronic dosing effects of these drugs in combination with PCP.

The effects of chlordiazepoxide, amphetamine and cocaine on bar-press behavior in normal and genetically nervous dogs.

Studies on two strains of pointer dogs have demonstrated that administration of a benzodiazepine (chlordiazepoxide) facilitates acquisition of goal-directed behavior in "genetically nervous"
The concomitant administration of either cocaine or amphetamine, compounds which inhibit neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine, disrupts the behavioral response of the genetically nervous E-strain subjects to a far greater extent than the stable A-strain subjects.

By contrast, spermidine (1 mM) and putrescine (1 mM) had no significant effect on the translocation when added alone. 
Spermine, and to a lesser extent, spermidine, enhanced the translocating action of oleate and increased its effectiveness in transferring the phosphohydrolase from the soluble to the microsomal fraction.

The EC50 values for isoproterenol, which is not a substrate for norepinephrine uptake-1, were reduced in myocardium in functional classes II to III and IV compared with those in nonfailing myocardium. 
The uptake inhibitors cocaine and desipramine (3 mumol/liter) potentiated the positive inotropic effects of norepinephrine in nonfailing myocardium (p < 0.05) but not in functional class IV myocardium. 
Radioligand binding experiments using the uptake inhibitor hydrogen-3 mazindol revealed a significant decrease by approximately 30% in norepinephrine uptake-1 carrier density in functional classes II to III and IV myocardium versus nonfailing myocardium (p < 0.05). 
This defect in the failing heart can be mimicked by the effects of uptake blocking agents, such as cocaine and desipramine, in the nonfailing heart only.

SIDE EFFECTS (KEMSTRO) The most common adverse reaction during treatment with baclofen is transient drowsiness (10-63%).
The adverse experience profile seen with KEMSTROTM was similar to that seen with baclofen tablets.

Few systemic data have been collected on the metabolism of WELLBUTRIN following concomitant administration with other drugs or, alternatively, the effect of concomitant administration of WELLBUTRIN on the metabolism of other drugs.
In vitro studies indicate that bupropion is primarily metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 isoenzyme.
Therefore, the potential exists for a drug interaction between WELLBUTRIN and drugs that affect the CYP2B6 isoenzyme (e.g., orphenadrine and cyclophosphamide).
The threohydrobupropion metabolite of bupropion does not appear to be produced by the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.
The effects of concomitant administration of cimetidine on the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and its active metabolites were studied in 24 healthy young male volunteers.
Following oral administration of two 150-mg sustained-release tablets with and without 800 mg of cimetidine, the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and hydroxybupropion were unaffected.
Following oral administration of two 150-mg sustained-release tablets with and without 800 mg of cimetidine, the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and hydroxybupropion were unaffected.
Following oral administration of two 150-mg sustained-release tablets with and without 800 mg of cimetidine, the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and hydroxybupropion were unaffected.
However, there were 16% and 32% increases in the AUC and Cmax, respectively, of the combined moieties of threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion.
While not systematically studied, certain drugs may induce the metabolism of bupropion (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin).

In a study of 15 male subjects (ages 19 to 35 years) who were extensive metabolizers of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme, daily doses of bupropion given as 150 mg twice daily followed by a single dose of 50 mg desipramine increased the Cmax, AUC, and t1/2 of desipramine by an average of approximately 2-, 5- and 2-fold, respectively.

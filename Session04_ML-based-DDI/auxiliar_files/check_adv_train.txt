This interaction, which has not been investigated using higher doses of fluvoxamine, may be more pronounced if a 300 mg daily dose is co-administered, particularly since fluvoxamine exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics over the dosage range 100-300 mg. If alprazolam is co-administered with Fluvoxamine Tablets, the initial alprazolam dosage should be at least halved and titration to the lowest effective dose is recommended.
Diazepam: The co-administration of Fluvoxamine Tablets and diazepam is generally not advisable.
Evidence supporting the conclusion that it is inadvisable to co-administer fluvoxamine and diazepam is derived from a study in which healthy volunteers taking 150 mg/day of fluvoxamine were administered a single oral dose of 10 mg of diazepam.
Accordingly, diazepam and fluvoxamine should not ordinarily be co-administered.
Therefore, if theophylline is co-administered with fluvoxamine maleate, its dose should be reduced to one third of the usual daily maintenance dose and plasma concentrations of theophylline should to monitored.
